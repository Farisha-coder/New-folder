                <p>
                    at, (Felis catus), domesticated member (felid) of the family Felidae. The family is generally divided between cats from the subfamily Pantherinae, which roar (including lions, tigers, and leopards), and cats from the subfamily Felinae, which purr instead (including cougars, bobcats, and domestic cats). According to the latest research, purring likely stems from a special pad within the folds of a catâ€™s vocal cords, which adds an additional layer of fatty tissue that enables the folds to vibrate (purr) at low frequencies. Domestic cats are characterized by retractable claws, powerful bodies, acute senses, long tails, and specialized teeth adapted for hunting prey.

                    The following article deals with general characteristics of the domestic cat. For information on larger cats, see their individual entries (such as lion, tiger, and leopard). For information on housing the domestic cat, see cats as pets. For an account of the relationship of the cat family to other carnivores, see carnivore.
